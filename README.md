**Week 3 - 10/8 - 10/14**

Web viewer for 3D models using three.js

**10/14:** Project is able to properly parse and display .stl files, FileDropZone component working perfectly with drag and drop file uploads as well as triggering upload when clicked, wireframe functionality is working correctly, models are scaled when uploaded in an attempt to center them in the camera, and models have orbit controls with mouse pointer.

**Reflections/Improvements for future:** Add support for more filetypes, fix bugs around OBJ, FBX, and GLTF files loaders, fix toggles for lighting and scale, add dynamic window sizing for different displays.
